**Hello, it's been a little while hasn't it? If you haven't read my blog before then welcome! This post marks new beginnings for the site. It's been a hectic year that is fast coming to and end, and with it I wanted to throw a lick of paint on the website and get everything in a good place.**

So what's the deal you may ask? Well I wanted to shift the course of where the website was heading to something more focused on my interests, and most importantly my craft. It's an exceedingly self indulgent thing to do I know, but having a space to write to excrete all my ideas I felt was integral to me. Hopefully along the way I can share some interesting information for everyone's perusal and benefit.

## The Changes

So the biggest change to the site structure is transitioning over to Jekyll, which is an amazing static site generator from the cracking folks at <a href="http://www.github.com" target="\_blank">Github</a>. Shifting away from Wordpress felt like a natural progression, I wanted to take away the bloat - I simply don't need any of the extra bells and whistles it provides. As a result we have a website that is just super quick and a lean with several advantages:

* No more databases
* No more pesky updates
* Use of straightforward markdown languages
* Fully blog aware, which means it's SO easy to get blog posts out and have all the structural stuff in place
* It's super fast dudes! I don't need to load in anything I don't want to.

On top of everything above, it all just feels so much more developer friendly. I've been working with Jekyll on and off for a year or so now, and I quickly came to love it for its simplicity. It has all the tools I need as a front end dev to experiment and quickly create posts and pages - as well as little experiments here and there.

With all the above changes I decided to give the design a total overhaul, this site is all about the content, all about the experimentation - and as such the old design was getting in the way. I needed something almost brutally simple, and after looking around I took inspiration from lots of different minimalist blogs and produced what you see in front of you now. Overall I wanted it to be super fast, and easy to read (including for those of you on mobiles) - after all given most people read this sort of thing clutching onto their mobiles on a bus or a train, it made sense to do things this way.

So now the foundations have been laid down, we're ready to start! See you all on the road <3
